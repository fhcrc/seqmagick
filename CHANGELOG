0.5.0
=====

* Change `seqmagick extract-ids --source-format` to `--input-format` to match
other commands (GH-29)
* Support gzip- and bzip2-compressed inputs and outputs for most commands (GH-30)
* Change default input format for `sff` to `sff-trim`, which respects the
  clipping locations embedded in each sequence record.
* Add `--details-out` option to `seqmagick quality-filter`, which writes
  details on each read processed.
* Match barcode/primer `seqmagick quality-filter` against a trie; allows
  per-specimen barcodes.
* Remove `--failure-out` option from `seqmagick quality-filter`. See `--details-out`
* Raise an error if number of codons does not match number of amino acids in
  `seqmagick backtrans-align`
* Add `--sample` subcommand (GH-31)

0.4.0
=====

* Fix bug in --squeeze
* More informative messages in `seqmagick primer-trim`
* Added `--alphabet` flag to allow writing NEXUS (GH-23)
* Exiting without error on SIGPIPE in extract-ids, info (GH-17)
* Ambiguities are translated as 'X' in --translate (GH-16)
* Allowing '.' or '-' as gap character (GH-18)
* --name-prefix and --name-suffix no longer create a mangled description (GH-19)
* Files owned by another user can be mogrified, as long as they are group writeable (GH-14)
* Add `backtrans-align` subcommand, which maps unaligned nucleotides onto a
  protein alignment (GH-20)
* Allow FASTQ as input to quality-filter
* Significantly expand functionality of quality-filter: identify and trim
  barcodes/primers; report detailed failure information.
* Cleanup, additional tests
* Add `--drop` filter to convert and mogrify (GH-24)
* Apply current umask when creating files (GH-26)
* Support stdin in `seqmagick info` (GH-27)
* Support translating ambiguous nucleotides, if codon translation is unambiguous

0.3.1
=====

* Fix bug in quality-filter MinLengthFilter
* Case consistency in seqmagick

0.3.0
=====

* Internal reorganization - transformations are converted to partial functions,
  then applied.
* Argument order now affects order of tranformation application.
* Change default output format to 'align' for TTYs in seqmagick info
* Add BioPython as dependency (closes GH-7)
* Add primer-trim subcommand
* Add option to apply custom function(s) to sequences
* Add new filtering options: --squeeze-threshold, --min-ungapped-length
  --include-from-file --exclude-from-file
* Removed seqmagick muscle
* Added new subcommand `quality-filter`
* Added new subcommand `extract ids` (closes GH-13)
* Allow use of '-' to indicate stdin / stdout (closes GH-11)
* Add mapping from .phyx to phylip-relaxed (targeted for BioPython 1.58)

0.2.0
=====

* Refactoring
* Added hyphenation to multi-word command line options (e.g.
  --deduplicatetaxa -> --deduplicate-taxa)
* Add support for .needle, .sff formats
* Close GH-4
